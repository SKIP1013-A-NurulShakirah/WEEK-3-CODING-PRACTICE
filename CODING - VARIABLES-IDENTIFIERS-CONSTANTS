		//----------VARIABLES----------
		
		//Variable              : a name for a location in memory that holds a value
		//Variable declaration  : specifies the variable's name and the type of information that it will hold 
		//Example data type     : int, double, string, float, char
		//Example variable name : total, count, sum, average
				
		int num1 = 10, num2 = 50, sum;
				
		sum = num1 + num2;

		//----------IDENTIFIERS----------
		
		//Variable names : start with a 'lowercase' letter 
		//Class names    : start with an 'uppercase' letter 
		//Constant names : are in 'uppercase' letters

		
		//----------CONSTANTS----------
		
		//Constant : an identifier that is similar to a variable except that it holds the same value during its entire existence
		//As the name implies, it is constant, not variable
		//The compiler will issue an error if you try to change the value of a constant
		//In Java, we use the 'final' modifier to declare a constant
		//Example : final int MIN_HEIGHT = 69;
		
		final double PI = 3.14159265;
		
		System.out.println("The PI value is " +PI);
		System.out.println("\n");
		
		//Constants are useful for three important reasons:
		
		//(i) They give meaning to otherwise unclear literal values
		        //(Example: MAX_LOAD means more than the literal 250)
		
		//(ii) They facilitate program maintenance 
		          //(If a constant is used in multiple places, its value need only be set in one place)
		
		//(iii) They formally establish that a value should not change, avoiding inadvertent errors by other programmers

//The + operator is also used for arithmetic addition
//The function that it performs depends on the type of the information on which it operates
//If both operands are strings, or if one is a string and one is a number, it performs string concatenation
//If both operands are numeric, it adds them
//The + operator is evaluated left to right, but parentheses can be used to force the order
